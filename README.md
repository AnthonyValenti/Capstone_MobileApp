# Capstone Mobile Application

For this project our group designed and implemented a smart reminder and notification system for a work environemnt, I was responsible for building the mobile application. The system consisted of a cross-platform mobile application as well as a touchscreen "central hub" system designed using a Raspberry Pi 3. The main features our system provided were scheduling calender events, creating reminders, employee messaging, smart bulb control and checking the weather. The mobile application also interacted with the raspberry Pi via Bluetooth to determine which mobile devices were within close proximity of the central hub, this was used to log entrances /exits into the office.
