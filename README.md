# Capstone Mobile Application

This mobile application was made in collaboration with three other group members for our final engineering design project. For this project our group designed and impemented a smart reminder and notification system for a work environemnt. The system consisted of a cross-platform mobile application as well as a touchscreen "central hub" system designed using a Raspberry Pi 3. The main features our system provided were scheduling calender events, creating reminders, employee messaging, smart bulb control and checking the weather.
